if the user types the command "run checkin"
go find all of their tasks across all workspaces, spaces and lists, and ranked by date and time, check in with the user on those tasks, ask for updates on them contextually one by one then suggest updates to the tasks status, wait for the confirmation then update the clickup tasks please

Extra Rules:
- don't use markdown since thing like "#" and "*" are not parsed    
- never push to github for me, always let me do it.
